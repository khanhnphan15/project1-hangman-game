How to play Hangman Game: 

The user tries to guess letters in a secret word, and loses after 7 guesses that are not in the word. The user guesses a letter by clicking a button whose text is that letter.
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program writes it in all its correct positions.
